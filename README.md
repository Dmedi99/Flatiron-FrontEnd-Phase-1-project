# Hot Board Games Website

This is a simple web application that displays a list of the hottest board games. Users can explore the list of board games, search for specific games by name, and add games to a wishlist for future reference.

## How It Works

1. **Displaying Board Games**: Upon loading the website, the hottest board games are fetched from the BoardGameGeek API and displayed in a list format. Each item in the list includes the name of the game and the year it was published.

2. **Searching for Games**: Users can use the search form to find specific board games by name. When a search term is entered, the application fetches the games from the API and filters the list based on the search criteria. The filtered results are then displayed.

3. **Adding to Wishlist**: If a user finds a game of interest, they can click on the game in the board games list to add it to the wishlist.
